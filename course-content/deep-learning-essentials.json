            <h3>Neural Networks</h3>
            <p>Artificial neural networks are computing systems vaguely inspired by the biological neural networks that constitute animal brains. They consist of interconnected nodes (neurons) that process information using dynamic state responses to external inputs.</p>
            <h4>Structure of Neural Networks:</h4>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Input Layer:</strong> Receives data from the external environment</li>
              <li><strong>Hidden Layers:</strong> Process the data through weighted connections</li>
              <li><strong>Output Layer:</strong> Produces the final result</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Learning Process:</h4>
            <p>Neural networks learn by adjusting connection weights through a process called backpropagation, minimizing the difference between predicted and actual outputs.</p>
            <h4>Activation Functions:</h4>
            <p>Functions that determine whether a neuron should be activated. Common ones include ReLU, Sigmoid, and Tanh.</p>
