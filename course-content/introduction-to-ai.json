            <h3>What is Artificial Intelligence?</h3>
            <p>Artificial Intelligence (AI) is intelligence demonstrated by machines, in contrast to the natural intelligence displayed by humans and animals. Leading AI textbooks define the field as the study of \"intelligent agents\": any device that perceives its environment and takes actions that maximize its chance of successfully achieving its goals.</p>
            <p>AI research has been defined as the field of study of intelligent agents, which refers to any system that learns how to recognize its environment and takes actions that maximize its chance of success.</p>
            <h4>Key Concepts:</h4>
            <ul>
              <li>Perception and reasoning</li>
              <li>Learning from experience</li>
