            <h3>Natural Language Processing (NLP)</h3>
            <p>Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a field of artificial intelligence that focuses on the interaction between computers and humans through natural language. The ultimate objective of NLP is to enable computers to understand, interpret, and generate human language in a valuable way.</p>
            <h4>Key Components of NLP:</h4>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Speech Recognition:</strong> Converting spoken language to text</li>
              <li><strong>Natural Language Understanding:</strong> Comprehending the meaning of text</li>
              <li><strong>Natural Language Generation:</strong> Producing human-readable text from data</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Applications:</h4>
            <p>NLP powers virtual assistants, translation services, sentiment analysis, text summarization, and chatbots that we interact with daily.</p>

              <h4>Historical Context</h4>
              <p>NLP has its roots in the 1950s, with early work on machine translation. The field has evolved from rule-based approaches to statistical methods and now to deep learning techniques.</p>

            <h3>Text Preprocessing in NLP</h3>
            <p>Before text can be processed by NLP models, it must be cleaned and converted into a format that the model can understand. This preprocessing is crucial for model performance.</p>
            <h4>Common Preprocessing Steps:</h4>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Tokenization:</strong> Breaking text into individual words or subwords</li>
              <li><strong>Lowercasing:</strong> Converting text to lowercase for consistency</li>
              <li><strong>Stopword Removal:</strong> Removing common words like "the", "and", "is"</li>
              <li><strong>Stemming/Lemmatization:</strong> Reducing words to their root forms</li>
              <li><strong>Removing Special Characters:</strong> Cleaning up punctuation and symbols</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Why Preprocessing Matters:</h4>
            <p>Preprocessing helps reduce noise in the data and can improve model performance by focusing on meaningful content.</p>

            <h3>Text Representations in NLP</h3>
            <p>Computers need numerical representations of text to process it. There are several approaches to convert text into numerical vectors:</p>
            <h4>Traditional Representations:</h4>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Bag of Words (BoW):</strong> Represents text as a vector of word frequencies</li>
              <li><strong>TF-IDF:</strong> Weighted approach that considers word frequency and rarity across documents</li>
              <li><strong>One-hot Encoding:</strong> Binary representation of words</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Modern Representations:</h4>
            <p>Word embeddings like Word2Vec, GloVe, and FastText create dense vector representations that capture semantic relationships between words.</p>
            <h4>Contextual Embeddings:</h4>
            <p>Models like BERT create embeddings that depend on the context in which a word appears.</p>

            <p>These models predict the probability of sequences of words. They can be used to generate text, answer questions, and more.</p>
            <h4>Transformer Architecture:</h4>
            <p>Introduced in the paper "Attention Is All You Need", transformers use attention mechanisms to process input and output sequences in parallel.</p>
