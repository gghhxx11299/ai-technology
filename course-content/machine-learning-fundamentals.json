            <h3>How Machine Learning Works</h3>
            <p>Machine Learning (ML) is a subset of Artificial Intelligence that provides systems the ability to automatically learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed. The core idea is to develop algorithms that can access data and use it to learn for themselves.</p>
            <h4>Core Concepts:</h4>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Training Data:</strong> Historical data used to train the model</li>
              <li><strong>Features:</strong> Input variables that the model uses to make predictions</li>
              <li><strong>Labels:</strong> Output variables that the model predicts</li>
              <li><strong>Model:</strong> The mathematical representation that makes predictions</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Learning Process:</h4>
            <p>Machine learning algorithms build a model based on training data in order to make data-driven predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed to do so.</p>
